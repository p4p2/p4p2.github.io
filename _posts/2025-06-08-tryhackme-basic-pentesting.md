###  Summary: This walkthrough covers the Basic Pentesting room on TryHackMe, a beginner-friendly Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed to introduce essential skills in penetration testing. The room simulates a vulnerable machine, and the tasks focus on enumeration, exploiting weak credentials, and privilege escalation.




##  Introduction

Penetration Testing (or Pentesting) is the practice of simulating real-world cyberattacks in a legal and controlled environment to uncover security weaknesses before malicious hackers do. The goal is to assess the system‚Äôs resilience and offer actionable insights to improve security.

In this write-up, we‚Äôll walk through the Basic Pentesting room step-by-step. It‚Äôs ideal for beginners looking to develop skills in reconnaissance, brute forcing, service enumeration, and basic Linux privilege escalation.

In this writeup, we are going to see how a basic penetration testing works step by step. We‚Äôll explore the following points:

    Brute forcing
    Hash cracking
    Service enumeration
    Linux Enumeration

**Room Name:** Basic-Pentesting  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Skills Covered:** Enumeration, Exploiting Weak Credentials, Privilege Escalation  
**Target IP:** 10.10.XX.XX

## Task 1: The first task is discovering the services that exposed. ‚úÖ


so we will run nmap for find host discovery, port scanning, service and OS detection, and so on.

sudo nmap -sT -sV -O -v -T4 10.10.x.x

## Task 2: üîç The second task is about finding hidden paths in the web server.‚úÖ

For this we have to run Gobuster for directory enumerate.

The answer is development.

## Task 3: The third task is about the finding users and passwords via brute-force methods

if you notice when we ran the nmap that time you can see samba service is running So I‚Äôll use enum4linux program to find users.

i run   enum4linux -a 10.10.x.x

First username is jan.

## Task 4: What is the password?

If you go back and look at the nmap scan result, you will see that the SSH service is running. So I‚Äôll use hydra to brute forcing to SSH service.

The password is armando

## Task 5: What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?

Service is SSH

We‚Äôve got the username and password. Now, I‚Äôll log in via SSH.

ssh jan@10.10.x.x  

After gaining control of the target host, I want the user.txt flag.

Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation

## Task 5: What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?

if you to back when we use  enum4linux  tool we got another user.

other user name kay

Now we will go to kay user directory and here you can see .ssh file 

![gobuster Image](/assets/kay1.png)

now we go into .ssh folder here you can see one public key and one private key

![gobuster Image](/assets/ssh.png)

we copy the private key 

![gobuster Image](/assets/ssh-cp.png)

make a file id there we paste the key and save it

now we use ssh2john for converte it to hash

ssh2john id > hash1.txt  

![gobuster Image](/assets/hash.png)

now lets lcrakk the hash by jhon 

john hash1.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 

![gobuster Image](/assets/hash-crakk.png)

So finally we got the password now we can login to kay by ssh

but befor login we have to give permision of that key so we use chmod 600 id  command

![gobuster Image](/assets/kay.png)

and now you can see we got the flag.

## Task 6: What is the final password you obtain?
